## PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL, often referred to as "Postgres," is a powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robustness, extensibility, and standards compliance. PostgreSQL is generally classified as a relational database management system (RDBMS), which falls under the SQL (Structured Query Language) category. It follows the principles of a traditional relational database, organizing data into tables with rows and columns and using SQL for querying and manipulation.
- While PostgreSQL is firmly rooted in the SQL tradition, it does have some features that bring it closer to the NoSQL world. For instance, it supports JSON data types and has functions for working with semi-structured data. This allows developers to store and query data in a more flexible, schema-less manner, which is a characteristic often associated with NoSQL databases.
- So, while PostgreSQL is primarily SQL-based, it offers some features that provide a bridge between SQL and NoSQL paradigms, making it a versatile choice for a variety of applications and data models. 

- ACID Compliance:
PostgreSQL adheres to the principles of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring reliable and transactionally consistent operations. This is crucial for applications requiring data integrity, such as financial systems and enterprise-level applications.

- Extensibility:
One of PostgreSQL's strengths is its extensibility. It supports a wide range of data types, indexing options, and functions. Additionally, users can create custom data types, operators, and functions, allowing for a high degree of flexibility in modeling and processing data.

- Scalability:
PostgreSQL is designed to scale vertically and horizontally. Through techniques like table partitioning, parallel processing, and support for clustering solutions, it can handle large datasets and high-traffic applications.

- Query:
In PostgreSQL, queries are constructed using the Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is a powerful and standardized language for interacting with relational databases, and PostgreSQL provides a comprehensive set of features and syntax for querying and manipulating data.



- Set up Backend with Django and PostgreSQL:
Follow the steps mentioned earlier to set up Django with PostgreSQL. Ensure that your Django application is configured to connect to your PostgreSQL database.

- Create API Endpoints:
Using Django views and Django REST Framework (if you're building a RESTful API), create API endpoints that allow your frontend to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your PostgreSQL database.

- Handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
If your frontend and backend are hosted on different domains, you'll need to handle CORS to allow requests from your frontend to your backend API. You can use Django CORS headers or middleware to handle CORS-related issues.

- Implement Authentication and Authorization (optional):
If your application requires user authentication and authorization, implement it in your Django backend. This might involve using Django's built-in authentication system or third-party libraries like Django REST Framework JWT for token-based authentication.

- Frontend Development:
Develop your frontend application using a frontend framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular. Use JavaScript or TypeScript to make HTTP requests to your Django backend API endpoints.

- HTTP Requests:
In your frontend application, use libraries like Axios or the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to your Django backend API endpoints. These requests can include fetching data from the database, submitting form data, or performing other actions.

- Handle Responses:
Handle responses received from the backend API in your frontend application. Update the UI based on the data received from the backend, and handle any errors that occur during the request.
